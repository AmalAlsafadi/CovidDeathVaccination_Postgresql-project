# Covid Death Vaccination 

In this project I applied EDA on the datset. I used Postgresql PGADMIN4

The questions that were invistigated are:
                                       
	1. What is the liklihood of dying if you get covid?
  2. What is the percentage of population who got covid?
	3. Which countries has the highest infection rate per population?
	4. Which countries has the hieghest death rate per population?
	5. What is vacinations rate vs. population?
